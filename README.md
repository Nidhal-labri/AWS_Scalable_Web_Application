**AWS EC2-based Scalable Web Application with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling**

This project demonstrates how i deployed a simple web application on AWS using EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and scalability with Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). The setup follows best practices for compute scalability, security, and cost optimization.
